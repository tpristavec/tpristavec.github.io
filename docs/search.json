    "text": "Iâ€™m an all-purpose quantitative social scientist with a doctorate in sociology and postdoctoral training in applied statistics. I spent several years in (quasi-)academia working on collaborative projects with local, state, and federal government partners before deciding I wanted to use 100% of my time on solving real world problems and 0% climbing the tenure track ladder.\nI enjoy experimenting in R, sprouting and watching plants grow, flying, all sorts of physical activity, and good green tea."
