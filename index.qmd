*People Research Scientist \@ Meta*

I'm an all-purpose quantitative social scientist with a doctorate in sociology and postdoctoral training in applied statistics. I spent several years in (quasi-)academia working on collaborative projects with local, state, and federal government partners before deciding I wanted to use 100% of my time on solving real world problems and 0% climbing the tenure track ladder.

I enjoy experimenting in R, sprouting and watching plants grow, [flying](https://my.flightradar24.com/tejapristavec), all sorts of physical activity, and good green tea.
